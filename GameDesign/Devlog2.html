 <p style="color: white;">My game is going to be about you playing as a pizza delivery person for a intergalactic pizza delivery service. The objective of which you are to deliver pizza in a semi open world area to a set number of people before you can return to the main hub and you will be doing this with the aid of pickups and advance movement system. The feel of the game would be similar to an arcade game where you are scored based on how well you performed.</p>
