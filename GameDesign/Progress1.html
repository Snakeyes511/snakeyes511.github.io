 <p style="color: white;">The title of this article "Less talk more rock" means that when it comes to games, talking should be reduced to a minimum and gameplay should be top priority. I agree with this to some extent because depending on the game, the amount of exposition would vary, for example, story driven games would require abit more exposition than a game thats not story driven</p>
