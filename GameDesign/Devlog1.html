 <p style="color: white;">So far I've been working on the techical side of my game so most of the work is more geared towards the mechanical side. currently has a sliding mechanic as well as a double jump along with the basic movements.</p>
 <p style="color: white;">I'm planning on making a parkour game similar to "Get to the orange door" without the enemies. As for the story for the game, I'm currently still thinking of the story for the game but for now I'm more focused on how to make levels built around the current mechanics I have.</p>
